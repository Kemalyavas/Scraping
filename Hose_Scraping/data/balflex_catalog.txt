Balflex® hydraulic textile braided hoses are produced to Balflex®
specifications and according to ISO 4079. SAE J517 and EN 854
standards. They cover a wide variety of low and medium pressure
applications. for petroleum and water base hydraulic fluids.

Balflex® optimized the production of these hoses and their
compatibility with a wide range of connectors. in order to assure the
highest performance and the most extensive range of applications.

Waterblast Hoses
Balflex® Waterblast hoses are produced to Balflex® specifications.
They cover a wide variety of very high pressure applications. in
rubber. steel spiral reinforcement. for waterjet cutting and waterjet
cleaning equipment and not recommended for hydraulic
oil applications.

Our Waterblast hose range 1100 – 1250 Bar. are used for cleaning
of chemical and power supply installations. cleaning and cutting of
concrete construction. pavement. steel surface and steelwork. tanks.
vessels. mining installations.

Balflex® optimized the production of these hoses and their
compatibility with Balfit Waterblast connectors. in order to assure
the highest performance in hardest conditions.

Balflex® hydraulic high temperature hoses are produced to Balflex®
specifications and according to ISO 1436. ISO 11237. SAE J517 and
EN 853 to EN 857 standards. They cover a wide variety of medium
pressure applications. for petroleum and water base hydraulic fluids.
They are however not suitable for Hot Dry Air applications.

Balflex® optimized the production of these hoses and their
compatibility with a wide range of connectors. in order to assure the
highest performance and the most extensive range of applications.

Balflex® Balflon hoses are produced to Balflex® specifications and
meet and exceed SAE J517 R14 standard. They cover a wide variety
of medium pressure applications. in PTFE. smooth and convoluted
with stainless steel reinforcement. for a very large variety of chemical
fluids. as well as traditional hydraulic fluids and steam.

Balflex® optimized the production of these hoses and their
compatibility with a wide range of connectors. in order to assure the
highest performance and the most extensive range of applications.

Balinox is the corrugated stainless steel hose range by Balflex®.
Balinox stainless steel hoses are produced to Balflex® specifications
and to ISO 10380 type 2 standards. It covers a wide variety of low
to very high-pressure applications. in different grades of stainless
steel. with different construction methods of the inner tube and
of the reinforcement braid.

Stainless steel hoses facilitate relative movement of the parts to
be connected. adapt to thermal expansion. resist to high pressure
and offer good corrosion resistance to a wide range of fluids.

Balflex® optimized the production of these hoses in order to assure
the highest performance and the most extensive range of applications.
The Balinox range of stainless steel hoses offer a very wide variety
of materials and construction solutions in order to suit the particular
problems to be addressed.

This graphic helps finding the Nominal Hose Diameter-DN (mm) or the Dash Size. Firstly. one must
know the Flow Rate and Fluid Velocity values that are being used. These two pieces of information must
be found in the outer graphic lines. Then by linking these two values with a straight line. one should
obtain the Nominal Hose Diameter-DN (mm) or the Gauge Diameter-A (cm²). The example below shows
that for a fluid velocity of 4 meters per second and a flow rate of 70 liters per minute or 19 gallons per
minute. one should choose a hose with DN of 19mm it means 3/4” hose or a dash hose -12.
